## Description

Image logo.svg, located in two folders:

- `/public/img`
- `/app/assets/img`

Referencing the image, `src=/img/logo.svg` in img, NuxtImg and yields console error:

```txt
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (IPX_FILE_NOT_FOUND).  Resources must be listed in the web_accessable_resources manifest key in order to be loaded.
```

and server:

```log
ERROR  Pre-transform error: Failed to resolve import "#app-manifest" from "node_modules/.pnpm/.....
```

## Explanation

`@Nuxt/image` module uses a server-side image proxy component for image processing.  IPX is a general term used for image optimization systems.  IPX processes an image requested by the user, and delivers an optimized image to the user's browser.

### GH Issue

[GitHub issue #30367](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/30367) related to the app manifest in Nuxt 3.15

Suggested workaround, add to `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts
experimental: { appManifest: false },
```

## Result

Same errors.
