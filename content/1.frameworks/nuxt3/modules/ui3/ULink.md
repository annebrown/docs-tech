## Description

The `ULink` component wraps `<NuxtLink>` and provides additional functionality, including additional styling classes, like `active-class` and route matching.

## VS Code Config

For class autocompletion, add to `.vscode/settings.json`:

```ts
{
    "tailwindCSS.classAttributes": [
      "active-class",
      "inactive-class"
  ],
}
```
