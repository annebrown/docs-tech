`useRoute()`

```ts
const router = useRouter()
const route = useRoute()

const configuredRoute = router.getRoutes().find((r) => r.name === route.name)
const hasChildren = configuredRoute?.children && configuredRoute.children.length > 0
```

`configuredRoute`

`getRoutes()`

`(r) => r.name === route.name`

- Search condition - look for route whose name matches hat of current route
