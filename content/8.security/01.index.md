## Local HTTPS

Sites not using HTTPS are marked as "not secure", and produce an extra "warning" browser panel, taking up valuable browser window space.

To remove the browser warning panel, create a private key and a local SSL cert to serve dev servers over HTTPS.

### Root Private Key

```bash
mkdir ~/certs
cd ~/certs
openssl genrsa -out 192.168.5.555.key 2048
```

## Root Self-Signed Cert

Create root cert, using dev server hostname or IP, for `Common Name`:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key 192.168.5.555.key -out 192.168.5.555.crt -days 3650
```

## Use Cert

Install the CA cert pkg:

```bash
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates
```

Add cert to trust store and update store:

```bash
sudo cp 192.168.5.555.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

## Dev Server Config

`nxut.config.ts`:

```ts
  devServer: {
    host: '192.168.5.555:3000',
    https: {
      key: '../../../../certs/192.168.5.555.key',
      cert: '../../../../certs/192.168.5.555.crt'
    }
  },
```
